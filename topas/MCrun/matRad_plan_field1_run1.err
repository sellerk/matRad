Note that TOPAS omitted scoring one or more hits during this session because
Geant4 navigation seemed to be at the wrong level of the parameterization for this scorer.
The total number of affected hits was: 4514
The total energy of affected hits was: 0.000135567 MeV
For details on each unscored hit, see the console log for lines starting with:
"Topas experienced a potentially serious error in scoring"
If you have only a small number of unscored hits, there is generally no cause for alarm.
If you have a large number of unscored hits, this may be due to a problem in Geant4 navigation.
You can set TOPAS to limit the number of messages about this parameterization error by setting
the parameter Ts/ParameterizationErrorMaxReports
You can set TOPAS to exit if it exceeds a given number of unscored hits by setting
the parameter Ts/ParameterizationErrorMaxCount
You can set TOPAS to exit if it exceeds a given total energy from unscored hits by setting
the parameter Ts/ParameterizationErrorMaxEnergy
